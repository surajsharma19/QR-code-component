## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learn about basic of HTML and CSS and also about how to use postion to center the element, what is the use of max-width and how to use box-shadow. 

```css
.card{
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 302px;
    height: 470px;
    position: absolute;
    margin: auto;
    inset: 0;
    border-radius: 16px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px hsla(219, 15%, 55%, 0.304);
    padding: 16px;
    text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I am learning more about CSS and will learn more about flexbox, grid and responsiveness.
